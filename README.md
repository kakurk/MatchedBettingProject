# Matched Betting Project
A short project on matched betting.

Matched betting is the idea that you can (possibly) guarantee yourself a profit by betting both sides of a sports wager.

These possibilities can exist if the odds offered by two sports books have an implied probability less than 100% OR in situations where a sportsbook offers a free "bonus" bet.

The goal of the repository is to build a table of available online sports bets in NY alongside the best possible laybets to identify where (or if) these opportunities are available.
